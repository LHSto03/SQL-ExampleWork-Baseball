-- Calculating change in Slugging Percentage (SLG) between 2020 and 2021 to compare with Fly Ball Rate (FBperc) in 2021.
-- Hypothesis: Players with higher Fly Ball Rate in 2021 would be impacted greatest by change to the aerodynamics of the baseball and
-- would subsequently reduce the player's Slugging Percentage.
-- Data exported to Tableau to create visualization.
-- Conclusion: No correlation between Fly Ball Rate and change in Slugging Percentage.
-- *Note: Data as of May 27, 2021.
